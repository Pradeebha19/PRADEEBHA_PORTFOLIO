About Me

Hi, I’m Pradeebha — a data whisperer, lifelong learner, and tech enthusiast currently shaping my path in the world of data science. With a curious mind and a strong foundation in mathematics and machine learning, I dive into datasets the way others dive into books — searching for stories, patterns, and possibilities.

My journey has taken me from classrooms in Pondicherry to the lecture halls of the University of Greenwich in London, with stops along the way as a curriculum developer and hands-on trainer. I’ve taught others to code, built tools to solve real-world problems, and stayed endlessly fascinated by the way data can drive smarter decisions.

I believe in blending creativity with logic, curiosity with clarity — and I'm on a mission to turn raw data into meaningful impact. Whether it’s through Python scripts, data visualizations, or cloud-based solutions, I’m always up for a new challenge that keeps me learning and growing.
